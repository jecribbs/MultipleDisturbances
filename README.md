# MultipleDisturbances
Scripts in this folder bring in data from the Transcribed Data folder on Google Drive, clean the data, and run analyses related to the multiple disturbances paper. 
Scripts are designed to be run in order with script 1 bringing in a user defined function into the global environment. Script 2 then reads in the raw data from the Google Drive and applies the function to transform the data from a series of lists to a data frame and converts the data format from wide to long format. Script 3 cleans up the raw data by recoding unknown species, and taking care of misspellings and other inconsistencies. Script 4 calculates species richness for understory species.
