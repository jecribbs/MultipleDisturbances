# Tree Map 
# 30 January 2025
# Author: Jenny Cribbs
# Inputs: plot data from the event ID script, tree data and plot data read in from the Google Sheets
# Code Description: (1) spatial data wrangling to use plot beginning waypoints in utms to calculate plot end waypoints in utms based on azimuth and transect length in meters (2) visualize points (3) choose calculated or gps waypoint to get one end point per plot (4) visualize result (5) convert all points to decimal degrees. (6) calculate utms for associated trees based on dOut and dSide (7) calculate utms for pila based on dOut and dSide (8) map all trees and pila (from gps and xy)
# Output: (1) a csv file with lat/long coordinates for each plot beginning and end point. (2) a csv file with lat/long coordinates for each tree.

## PILA Position Accounting
# E10-PILAs 2-6 have a dOut, but no dSide (measured or estimated)--> recorded correctly in the field, but dSideL was entered as positive, so the conversion adds NAs?
# E14-PILA1 has a dOut, but no dSide (measured or estimated)
# E15-PILAs 1-5, 7, 8, 13-16 (something wrong with dSide conversion? Need to convert dSideLs to negative)
# E-26 has UTMs, but also several dOuts without dSides--should ignore those, but check to see if dSide conversion went wrong
# E-26 last three trees 37, 38, 39 are missing dSides with no UTMs--entered correctly should have dOut, dSide
# E13-PILA 36 has a measured dSide (-39) and an estimated dOut (156)--> check this is fixed after estimated chunk
# E32-PILA 1,2 have missing dSide--this is one of a few cases where dSide_m was entered correctly into a dSide_m column with negatives and positives--need to pull in the this column, tree 3 had dOut entered in measured and estimated, but should be estimated
# E36-PILA 100 is missing dSide--no photo for this portion of the data, cannot review apparently missed
# E39 trees 1-31 have missing dSide--likely left entered without negative
# E43 1-3 have dout dside and UTMs--should use GPS UTMs ideally (WP entered)
# E43 PILA8 Waypoint 27 does not have UTMs entered, but ideally import from GPS
# E55 all PILAs 1-51 have dOut only
# E58 1-3 have both UTMs and dOut dSide--not sure which is more accurate, but definitly don't want duplicates
# E58-16 has relative position information that can be calculated WP29 + 10 and +8
# E59 all trees have no position information except PILA 7 (dout, dSide) and 12-19 (PILA_waypoint)--waypoint name only
# E6 27-33 have no position information--data sheet is clear for wp and UTMs, added waypoint number
# E60 trees 18-27 have estimated dOut only
# E61-PILA10 has dSide missing and conflicting estimated and measured dOut--should be 208.1 out and 10m dSideR
# E64-PILA1 has waypoint name and dOUt dside--go with waypoint
# E68-PILA48 has waypoint only
# E7, E8, and E29 have no PILA so NAs for position are real
# E73-PILA 30 has dOut in addition to waypoint name and UTMs--try using UTMs
# E73 PILAs 36 and 37 have estimated position information
